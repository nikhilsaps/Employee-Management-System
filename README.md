# Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a simple and efficient solution for managing employees within an organization. It utilizes a range of technologies to provide a seamless user experience and efficient data storage.

## Technology Stack

The system is built using the following technologies:

1. JavaScript
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. IndexedDB
5. Storage API

## Description

The Employee Management System is designed with a well-structured HTML and CSS foundation, incorporating Bootstrap for enhanced styling. JavaScript is responsible for handling animations and serving as the backend. The Storage API enables persistent storage of the required data, while IndexedDB provides efficient database storage and operations. It's important to note that the documentation file must be executed first, as it loads the necessary data into the storage API (local storage). The system is user-friendly and straightforward to navigate.
